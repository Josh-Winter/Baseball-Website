### by Josh Winter
## Description:
### Instructions:
This project is a website. To test it download the zip and transfer folder to a webserver with a file transfer program
like Filezila. Alternatively you can view the version I have running on my webserver linked here: https://jawinter.w3.uvm.edu/cs120/baseball.html
### Overview:
This project combines multiple languages to make a changing website based on user's selection. When the user first launches
the website they are greeted by the home page. The homepage features a JavaScript clock designed by me and a selection menu featuring
4 different baseball teams. When you select a baseball team baseball.cpp uses that selection to pull up the teams corresponding textfile
and feed it to process.php to be put on the website. Process.php also changes the style sheet based on the team selected and displays
unique JavaScript for each team of a Google Maps view of their stadium. On the footer of each page is a source for the info displayed 
and a link to the homepage so the user can check out another team.
### Languages:
This project uses C++, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### Module 3 Concepts:
This project is obviously inspired by the Hamilton website activity we did in class. This project use the command line 
interface (CLI) to communicate with different languages. This program also incorporates the usage of PHP as we were 
taught in class. I also heavily used the console command we were taught to transfer my files to the webserver.
### concepts not taught in this class:
To complete this project I used concepts from other class here at UVM. The majority of it came from CS 008 and CS 145 
with Professor Robert Erickson and CS-121 with Professor James Eddy.
### Future:
In the future I could add more information about each team as well as clean upp the css a little. I could also always add
more Teams to select.
### Grade:
Going through the rubric I would say that for the main program I deserve around 10 points because it is not super complex,
but it is about as difficult as a guided project. For the other programming language category I think I deserve 40 points
because of my heavy usage of JavaScript and PHP. For the non-programming language section I think I deserve 20 points for
my usage of my heavy CSS and HTML usage. For the CLI section I think I deserve 2 points for each line because my usage of 
the command line to pass info (C++ to PHP and PHP) is effective and makes sense.
