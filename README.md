# Baseball Website
### by Josh Winter
## Description:
### Instructions:
This project is a website. To test it download the zip and transfer folder to a webserver with a file transfer program
like Filezila. Alternatively you can view the version I have running on my webserver linked here: https://jawinter.w3.uvm.edu/cs120/baseball.html
### Overview:
This project combines multiple languages to make a changing website based on user's selection. When the user first launches
the website they are greeted by the home page. The homepage features a JavaScript clock designed by me and a selection menu featuring
4 different baseball teams. When you select a baseball team baseball.cpp uses that selection to pull up the teams corresponding textfile
and feed it to process.php to be put on the website. Process.php also changes the style sheet based on the team selected and displays
unique JavaScript for each team of a Google Maps view of their stadium. On the footer of each page is a source for the info displayed 
and a link to the homepage so the user can check out another team.
### Languages:
This project uses C++, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### Future:
In the future I could add more information about each team as well as clean upp the css a little. I could also always add
more Teams to select.
